About
=====

The **nisyscfg** package contains an API (Application Programming Interface)
for interacting with NI System Configuration. The package is implemented in Python.
This package was created by NI. The package is implemented as a complex, highly
object-oriented wrapper around the NI System Configuration C API using the
`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html>`_ Python library.

**nisyscfg** supports only the Windows and Linux operating systems.

**nisyscfg** supports CPython 3.5+ and PyPy3.

Installation
============

Note: Running **nisyscfg** requires the NI System Configuration Runtime. Visit the
`ni.com/downloads <http://www.ni.com/downloads/>`_ to download the latest version
of NI System Configuration.

Usage
=====
The following is a basic example of using an **nisyscfg.Session** object.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import nisyscfg
  >>> with nisyscfg.Session() as session:
  >>>     # Print user aliases for all National Instruments devices in the local system
  >>>     filter = session.create_filter()
  >>>     filter.is_present = True
  >>>     filter.is_in_product = True
  >>>     filter.is_device = True
  >>>     for resource in session.find_hardware(filter):
  >>>         print(resource.expert_user_alias[0])
